# Breach - 05/09/2017

<h1> Welcome to Breach </h1>
<p>
This may seem like a game, but in reality it is a fight for survival. You are given the unenviable task of assessing ED performance across the country.

You are working from home as this is where you have your system set up, and the national body has charged you to solve this problem for them.
</p>
<h4><em> You will be fed 'arrays' that central healthcare control has designed for you to assess </em></h4>
<p>
Within these arrays are contained the stats on the performance of each emergency department.

They will be in the form of an array or list as below in the Python example:
</p>
<b> ['safe', 'breach', 'safe', 'safe', 'breach'] </b>

<h2> The Rules <h2>
