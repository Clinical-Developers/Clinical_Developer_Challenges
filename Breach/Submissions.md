<h3>Right ok so we have 4 submissions this week:</h3>

<ol>
<li>First up is this bad-boy from Gregory Horne: https://gitlab.com/gregorydhorne/hospital-emergency-department-breach-status </li>
<li>Then we have this one by Stefan Mitrosinovic: https://github.com/Darkbladecr/ClinDev-breach?fref=gc&dti=257859457974818 </li>
<li>Then we have this one by Peter De Souza: https://github.com/pd6569/GameOfBreach </li>
<li>Then we have this one by Adam Morley: https://repl.it/Kshk/13 - if you put it in a repo Adam I will link it</li>
</ol>

<h4> Ok so let's put them all through their paces: Below is my ranking as well </h4>
<ol>
<li>Gregory Horne: I'm going to call this one Perl_Breach, I have literra <a href="http://tpcg.io/Ok5cjI">Live Demo</a> </li>
<li>Peter De Souza: https://repl.it/Ktq2/3 - Really like this one. It nicely increments the breach count and handles even real messes </li>
<li>Adam Morley: https://repl.it/Kshk/20 - so this one works fine ;) that is until I add in Peter's evil messy array that is [note this was outside the scope of the challenge]</li>
<li>Stefan Mitrosinovic: https://repl.it/Kts3/0 - Stefans one is really good. It so nearly works, but there is a tiny hitch - the online Python 3 environment is not happy with taking the length of a filter object and thus it is not working. Presumably you tested it in a different environment? I really like this though as it is such a tiny code, but is massively scalable. I didn't yet try feeding it a spreadsheet, but I can see it will work once this little bug is ironed out.</li>
</ol>
