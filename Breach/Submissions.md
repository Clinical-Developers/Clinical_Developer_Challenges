</ol>

<h4> Ok so let's put them all through their paces:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Gregory Horne: I'm going to call this one Perl_Breach, I have literrally never seen something so arcane and wonderful. http://tpcg.io/Ok5cjI It is so wonderful I couldnt' even test it, but I'm sure that Gregory has the document to prove it works. Then there is his bash shell version: "http://tpcg.io/PA1U3v! This is literally amazing and of things too wonderful for me to fully comprehend!</li>
<li>Peter De Souza: https://repl.it/Ktq2/3 - Really like this one. It nicely increments the breach count and handles even real messes, But it doesn't assess lots of different hospitals (Let me know if I missed something.</li>
<li>Adam Morley: https://repl.it/Kshk/20 - so this one works fine ;) that is until I add in Peter's evil messy array that is [note this was outside the scope of the challenge]</li>
<li>Stefan Mitrosinovic: https://repl.it/Kts3/1 - Stefans one is really good. It so nearly works, but there is a tiny hitch - the online Python 3 environment is not happy with taking the length of a filter object and thus it is not working. Presumably you tested it in a different environment? I really like this though as it is such a tiny code, but is massively scalable. I didn't yet try feeding it a spreadsheet, but I can see it will work once this little bug is ironed out.</li>
<li>Adam Figgins: https://cl.ly/453E3c323i2L, great little frontend here - add it to some of the others and you have the beginning of a real product!</li>
</ol>
