'''
A hospital clerk has entered all the hospital budget deficits on a spreadsheet but because they didn't know how to use excel all the values are expressed as positive integers. Can you build a function to solve this problem for them.
In any language come up with a simple function to invert any value and produce the negative opposite. eg. 156 -> -156. All working examples will be accepted and prizes awarded to the best example in each language, as well as the cleverest function to save the hospital from budgetary blindness. Try posting them in the comments below.

y=6
