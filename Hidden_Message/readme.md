You are working with a team of genetics researchers. You're told the exciting and confusing news that there may be a message from God hidden in our DNA! Through science and prayer your team has been able to work out the following:
* The message is hidden somewhere in the attached sequence of ~120,000 base pairs (gene_sequence.seq)
* God writes in stochastic binary, with 0 represented by either A or C, and 1 represented by either T or G
* God encodes in ASCII

Can you find the message?
