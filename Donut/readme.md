It's very simple- draw a donut What is a donut? At it's very least, it consists of 2 concentric circles At it's very most, it is a delicious iced dessert with sprinkles
You can use any programming language to make this, and I will look out for solutions which do one of a few things:
* Fewest lines of code (not really fair to non-python developers i know, sorry!)
* Best Donut
* Most creative solution

This is a bit of a departure from previous data analytics challenges, partly to welcome anyone who hasn't entered challenges before/ has been put of by them, and partly because graphics aren't always something considered in introductory programming courses, but are important to bear in mind!

Same deadline applies- I will look through the solutions on Sunday and feedback and choose the best ones. I'll be about to answer any questions intermittently.

A jammy doughnut rather than a torus, strictly speaking! But SVG is an amazing markup, you can do amazing things in web design with it!
